  ### About:
  #### This is a simple practice of three big major topics I believe it is used in almost any software nowadays Alarm Manager, Notification, and Broadcast Receiver.


 ### Summery:
 #### I use the new Kodein library implementation for classes dependency inject. and unfortunately, I did not have much time to structure the project very well and implement all business logic in Timer ViewModel which is a bad practice the view model's main purpose is should act as state holder when configuration changes happen, respond to manage UI state, save and restore state when UI is recreated.
